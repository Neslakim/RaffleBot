#Raffle Bot#
~~Simple bot that automatically joins raffles in Forsens and Pajladas channels. It also has the option to gamble the winnings on roulette automatically, or send a message upon winning. Feel free to leave feedback, bug reports, suggestions for improvement etc.~~  
I have a lot of extra time, so I decided to add some more features:  
* Added emotes and badges.
* Now able to choose whether to automatically join raffles.
* Shows messages where you are mentioned.
* Gamble away your points on roulette easily.
* Spam feature. Input a message, and it will spam it for you. This includes adding a '.' on every other message, and staying under the rate limit. Not very good or tested at the moment, and I would advise not to type manurally while this is activated. Might fuck up when combined with raffles. Uses include spamming emotes for daily quest, or when going for emote records (continued spam of the same thing).
